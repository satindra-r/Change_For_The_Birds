# Change For The Birds

## About the repository

### Well what is the problem anyway?

Climate change is causing havoc on all aspects of nature and life including birds. Migration patterns change, and their habitats are destroyed.

### So what is this about?

This repository is a java based game about taking photos of birds to spread the awareness.

#### But why a game?

Well sadly blogs and videos don't get spread very often especially education ones so I made a game.

### How do I play?

- It's simple birds will come to a bird feeder which is not empty and eat some food, you can click on the bird to take its photo and it will fly away.

- If your flash brightness is at 1 then surrounding birds will fly away too.

- You will get more money for some birds and less for others.

- The email level acts as a multiplier for the money.

- Using this money you can buy more feeders, upgrade email level, switch off your flash or upgrade your food type.

- Different food types attract different birds.

---

### Winning

Take a total of 1000 pictures to win

---

### What if I get stuck?

- If you prefer to do it alone you can delete your progress and restart the game or else you can drop me a message

- If you chose the latter send a picture of the application and the current time

- Then click on the enter code button and send me the Input code

- I will send a coupon code valid for 2 minutes which will give you 500ʙ of money

---

### Other things to do

- Take a photo of all the birds

- Take a photo of all the birds 10 times

- Take a photo of all the birds 50 times

- Upgrade everything to the maximum

###### How to decode food string

- The first character determines if the bird will come for a food type of 1

- The second character determines if the bird will come for a food type of 2

- The third character determines if the bird will come for a food type of 3

- 1 indicates yes and 0 indicates no
